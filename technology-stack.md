## Introduction
This document will introduce the programming languages, frameworks, tools, and services we prefer to build and ship software with. It also provides links to tools and guides to help you implement [contribution rules](/contribution-rules.md) and a [branching strategy](/branching-strategy.md) when setting up a new project.  

Choosing the right tech stack depends on multiple factors, such as the software type, functionalities, and requirements. It's impossible to cover all possibilities, nor is it our intention. But we encourage contributors to choose their stack as close as possible to what is covered here, so that other contributors would be familiar with it. Also, this will allow us to prepare guides and tools for implementing our development workflow once and use them in multiple projects.

## Languages

### Typescript
We use javascript because its ecosystem lets us build almost any software; this is important for the reasons we explained in the [introduction](#introduction). 

Not being a type-safe language, Javascript increases the chance of runtime errors and makes it extremely hard to read and maintain the project as it or the team working on it gets bigger. We prefer Typescript over Javascript because it has solved these issues, ensuring that we deliver safer software.
